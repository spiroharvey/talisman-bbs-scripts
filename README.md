# Spiro's Talisman BBS Scripts


This is a collection of scripts that I use for my Talisman BBS.

Some may be generic for Linux telnet BBSes, and others might be useful with
minor tweaking. 

These scripts are offered for free for your use and abuse, and 
no warranty is expressed or implied.

Pre-requisites:
 - inotify-tools

inotify-tools are used because as of writing, Talisman's event handler is
still in its infancy

I use an include file called "inc.bbsConfig" for commonly used variables and
functions.
